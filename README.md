# DATA-ASSESSMENT-CLEANING-ACTIVITY
Mobile Phone Data Cleaning and Analysis
This repository showcases a detailed analysis of mobile phone data, emphasizing thorough data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Leveraging Python libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn (sns), and Matplotlib (plt), the project ensures data integrity and reveals insights through visualizations. The focus is on creating new features from the dataset to enhance understanding and predictive modeling capabilities.

Key Features
The project begins with comprehensive data cleaning to address inconsistencies and missing values, ensuring a reliable dataset for analysis. Through exploratory data analysis, we uncover patterns, trends, and correlations within the mobile phone data. Visualizations generated using Seaborn and Matplotlib provide intuitive insights into the dataset, aiding in feature selection and model development. This repository serves as a resource for anyone interested in understanding the complexities of mobile phone data through structured analysis and visualization techniques.
